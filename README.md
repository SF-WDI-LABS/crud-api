## Contribution/Maintenance 

### ESLint for Linting and Auto-fixing Linting Errors

This project uses [eslint](http://eslint.org/)! The base configuration is [standard JS](https://standardjs.com/), with additional rules as defined in [.eslintrc.json](.eslintrc.json).  

To run the linter on this project without changing files, use the following command line command:

```
./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js ./
```

If you would like ESLint and standard to automatically fix linting issues, use the `--fix` option:


```
./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js ./ --fix
```

Especially when using the --fix option, prefer to lint one file or directory at a time by specifying a path within the project:

```
./node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js ./controllers/index.js ./controllers/utils.js
```

As a shorthand to run the linter on the entire project directory, you can use `npm run lint`.

Ingored directories and files are listed in  [.eslintignore](.eslintignore).


### Automated Tests with Mocha, Chai, supertest

This project uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [chai](http://chaijs.com/) for additional `expect` assertion styles, and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for HTTP request test runnign.  The command `npm test` runs all test code. Test files are in the `test` directory.

### Travis CI

Travis CI is enabled for this app. It will run tests and linting whenever a new push or a new pull request is made. Repo administrators can turn Travis on and off, and both admins and collaborators can control smaller-scale guides.  Travis is configured through the `travis.yml` file.  See Travis CI's [getting started guide[(https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) for information on how to control Travis' access to this repo through your admin or collaborator GitHub account.

### Automatic Heroku Deployment

The `heroku` branch is configured for easy deployment to heroku. See [Heroku's guide to GitHub integration / Heroku deploys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) for full information.  The integration is currently set up to allow easy manual deploys from the `heroku` branch, but admins can change this over to automatically deploy to Heroku if CI builds successfully.

When you want to deploy new versions to Heroku, push them to the `heroku` branch, check that Travis CI builds successfully, and then visit [the Super CRUD heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/super-crud/deploy/github) to manually deploy the `heroku` branch.  If you need permission to access the dashboard, seek SF WDI instructors.
